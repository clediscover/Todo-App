# Todo App

- This application is made with HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
- I made this app just for practicing my skill in jQuery.

Here are the things that you can do here:
1. Add todo - Add that through input. You can also submit a todo by hitting enter in keyboard. There are rules for creating todos, first is it should not be empty and last is it should not be repeated.
2. Clear all todos - You can do this by hitting the Del (Delete) on keyboard pr click the Clear All Todos button.

Here are the things that I need to add here:
1. Select and remove a todo individually.
2. Add dates on each todo, when it was created.

Here are some examples of this project:
1. Default/When there are no todos:

2. With some todos:
  ![](img/with-some-todos.png)
3. Adding todo that already exist:

4. Adding todo that is empty:

Here what you need to do in order to get/clone this, but first make sure you have git in your terminal/CMD.
1. On terminal/CMD do the following command:
  - git clone https://github.com/clediscover/Todo-App.git
2. Go to the directory, where you've cloned, then open the "index.html".
3. It's done!
